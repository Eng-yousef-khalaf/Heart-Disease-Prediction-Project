# ðŸ’“ Heart Disease Prediction using Random Forest

A machine learning classification project that predicts the presence of heart disease based on real-world medical data. This project uses a **Random Forest Classifier** to build a robust and accurate prediction model.

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

The goal of this project is to analyze medical data and predict whether a patient is likely to have heart disease. Early prediction can lead to better diagnosis and timely treatment.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Scikit-learn** for building and evaluating ML models
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** as the development environment

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset used is the [UCI Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset/data), which contains 14 key medical attributes such as:

- Age
- Resting Blood Pressure
- Serum Cholesterol
- Chest Pain Type
- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- And others...

## ðŸ§ª Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Exploration**  
   Understand the structure, types, and distribution of the dataset.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Converting categorical features  
   - Normalization (if needed)

3. **Feature Selection**  
   Analyze feature importance using the model.

4. **Model Building**  
   Trained a **Random Forest Classifier** using `scikit-learn`.

5. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Accuracy Score  
   - Confusion Matrix  
   - Precision, Recall, F1-score  
   - Feature Importance Plot

## âœ… Results

The Random Forest model achieved high performance on the test set, proving effective in identifying patients with heart disease. Key features contributing to prediction include `age`, `cholesterol`, and `max heart rate`.

## ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations

- Heatmap of feature correlations
- Confusion matrix visualization
- Feature importance bar plot
